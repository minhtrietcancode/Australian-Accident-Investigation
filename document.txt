Some key points that we will work on these two datasets

- Task 1: We will use the BoW techniques to identify the most 20 common words in the accident.csv dataset to identify 
some potential problems among these million of accident --> this will provide a fundamental observation for some of
the main reasons for these accidents

- Task 2: Convert the time of the accident into just 4 categories: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Late Night and then
create some charts to visualize the problems of some specific days, and the distribution of the accidents among these
4 categories
